    "description": "Chamomile cordial is a sweet, floral liqueur made by infusing chamomile flowers in a base spirit, typically combined with sugar and sometimes citrus to enhance its flavor. Chamomile, known for its soothing and aromatic properties, imparts a delicate, honeyed, and slightly earthy flavor to the cordial. This makes it an intriguing and versatile ingredient in cocktails, where it can add a subtle floral note and natural sweetness.",
