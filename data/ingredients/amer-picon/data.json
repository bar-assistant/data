    "description": "Amer Picon is a bitter, citrus-infused liqueur, and might best be thought of as a distant cousin to the Italian amaro family. The French term “Amer” literally means “bitter,” and Amers are thus a category in the French spirits world, with many variations that are all bitter and flavored with fruit, herbs and spices.",
