    "description": "Cask-proof bourbon, also known as barrel-strength or barrel-proof bourbon, refers to bourbon whiskey that is bottled directly from the cask without being diluted with water before bottling. This means that the bourbon is presented to consumers at its natural, undiluted alcohol strength, as it was when it matured in the barrel.\n\nWhen bourbon is aging in barrels, it undergoes changes in flavor and character as it interacts with the wood and other compounds present in the cask. Cask strength bourbon captures the full intensity of these flavors without the addition of water to lower the alcohol content.\n\nThe alcohol by volume (ABV) of cask-strength bourbon can be significantly higher than standard bottlings, often ranging from 110 proof (55% ABV) to well over 130 proof (65% ABV) or more. This higher proof can intensify the flavors and provide a more robust and concentrated drinking experience.\n\nCask-strength bourbons have gained popularity among whiskey enthusiasts who appreciate the opportunity to experience the full, unaltered expression of the bourbon as it was intended by the distiller. Some bourbon brands release limited-edition cask-strength bottlings, and these releases can be highly sought after by collectors and connoisseurs. When enjoying cask-strength bourbon, it is not uncommon for individuals to add a splash of water to their glass to personalize the drinking experience and open up additional flavors.",
