    "description": "Whiskey is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented grain mash. The grains used in whiskey production can include barley, corn, rye, and wheat. The production process involves mashing the grains, fermenting the mash, distilling the liquid, and aging it in wooden barrels, usually made of oak. The aging process imparts flavors and character to the whiskey.\n\nThe flavor, aroma, and characteristics of whiskey can vary widely based on factors such as the type of grains used, the distillation process, the type of barrels used for aging, and the duration of maturation. Whiskey is enjoyed in various ways, including neat, on the rocks, or as a key ingredient in cocktails.",
