    "description": "Orange juice is a popular and versatile cocktail ingredient, known for its sweet and tangy flavor profile. Extracted from fresh oranges, it brings a natural sweetness and subtle acidity to drinks, along with a bright, sunny color that enhances the visual appeal of cocktails.\n\nWhen using orange juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is ideal for the best flavor, though high-quality, not-from-concentrate commercial juices can be a convenient alternative. The amount used can vary widely depending on the recipe, from a splash for flavor to being the primary mixer in a drink. Its natural sweetness means it's often used in place of simple syrup in some recipes, adding both flavor and sweetness in one ingredient.",
