    "description": "Galliano is sweet with vanilla-anise flavour and subtle citrus and woodsy herbal undernotes.\n\nGalliano L'Autentico is a popular Italian liqueur with a golden yellow color. The unique herbal flavor medley is dominated by vanilla and anise, though its taste is complex. Developed in the late 19th century, Galliano is used in a variety of cocktails and is a staple in well-rounded bars today. Its most famous cocktails are the Harvey Wallbanger and golden Cadillac from the 1970s. While it's great for those retro drinks and many others, it also makes a nice digestif to enjoy after a meal.",
