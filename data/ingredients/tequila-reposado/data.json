    "description": "Tequila Reposado is a type of tequila that has been aged or \"rested\" in oak barrels for a specific period, giving it a mellower and more complex flavor compared to Tequila Blanco (unaged tequila). The term \"reposado\" translates to \"rested\" in Spanish.\n\nReposado occupies a middle ground between the youthful vibrancy of Blanco tequila and the more mature and complex characteristics of AÃ±ejo tequila. It appeals to those who appreciate a balance of agave flavor and the influence of oak aging.",
