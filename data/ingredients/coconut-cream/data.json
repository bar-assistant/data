    "description": "Coconut cream is a thick, rich, and smooth substance extracted from the flesh of mature coconuts. Coconut cream is similar to coconut milk, but it has a higher concentration of coconut solids, giving it a thicker consistency. It is often used in both savory and sweet recipes, including curries, soups, desserts, and beverages. Coconut cream is a key ingredient in many dishes in Southeast Asian, Caribbean, and other tropical cuisines.",
