    "description": "Sake is a traditional Japanese alcoholic beverage made from fermented rice. Unlike wine, which is fermented from fruit, sake is brewed more like beer, where the starch from rice is converted into sugars before being fermented into alcohol. Sake has a delicate, nuanced flavor profile that can range from sweet to dry, with notes of fruit, flowers, herbs, and umami, depending on the style and brewing process. The alcohol content typically ranges between 14% and 20%.\n\nIn cocktails, sake is often used as a base spirit or a modifier, bringing a subtle, smooth flavor that complements other ingredients without overpowering them. Its versatility allows it to pair well with a variety of flavors, from citrus and fruit to herbs and spices. Sake-based cocktails, like the Sake Martini or the Tokyo Mule, often emphasize its lightness and delicate flavor, making them ideal for those seeking a refined and refreshing drink.\n\nSake can also be enjoyed on its own, either chilled, at room temperature, or warm, depending on the type and the occasion. It is traditionally served in small ceramic cups and is an integral part of Japanese cuisine and culture. Sake's unique flavor and brewing process make it a distinct and sophisticated option for both traditional and modern cocktail creations.",
