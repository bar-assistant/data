Extracted from fresh limes, this citrus juice adds a vibrant, zesty kick to drinks, making it an indispensable ingredient in many classic and contemporary cocktails.\n\n\nWhen using lime juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is highly recommended for its superior taste and aroma. The amount used can vary depending on the recipe, but even a small quantity can significantly brighten and enliven a drink. Its versatility allows it to pair well with a wide range of spirits, from tequila and rum to gin and vodka.",

            "description": "Honey syrup is a natural sweetener used in cocktails to add depth and complexity beyond what standard simple syrup offers. Made by diluting honey with water, usually in a 1:1 ratio, this syrup brings not only sweetness but also subtle floral, herbal, or fruity notes depending on the type of honey used.\n\nWhen incorporating honey syrup into drinks, it's important to consider its distinct flavor profile. The type of honey used can significantly impact the final taste of the cocktail, allowing for creative variations. Bartenders often prefer to make their own honey syrup to control the consistency and flavor, though commercial versions are available. As with other syrups, the amount used can be adjusted to balance the cocktail's sweetness with other components.",
