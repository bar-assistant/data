            "description": "Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer and often in charred barrels, giving it a darker color and a richer, more robust flavor compared to lighter rums. It typically has notes of caramel, molasses, and sometimes spices. Dark rum is commonly used in cocktails, especially those with a strong, flavorful profile, and it is also enjoyed neat or on the rocks. The aging process contributes to the development of complex flavors and a smoother texture.",
