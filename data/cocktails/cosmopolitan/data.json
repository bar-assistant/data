    "description": "A cosmopolitan, or informally a cosmo, is a relative of cranberry coolers.\n\nThe cosmopolitan gained popularity in the 1990s. It was further popularized among young women by its frequent mention on the television program Sex and the City, where Sarah Jessica Parker's character, Carrie Bradshaw, commonly ordered the drink when out with her girlfriends. The film adaptation made a reference to its popularity when Miranda asks why they stopped drinking them, Carrie replies \"because everyone else started.\"",

It is typically produced from the fermentation and distillation of grains, potatoes, or sometimes fruits.

It is intentionally distilled to be a clean and pure spirit, allowing it to take on the characteristics of its base ingredients.",
