The production process involves mashing the grains, fermenting the mash, distilling the liquid, and aging it in wooden barrels, usually made of oak. The aging process imparts flavors and character to the whiskey.\n\nThe flavor, aroma, and characteristics of whiskey can vary widely based on factors such as the type of grains used, the distillation process, the type of barrels used for aging, and the duration of maturation. Whiskey is enjoyed in various ways, including neat, on the rocks, or as a key ingredient in cocktails.",

Extracted from fresh lemons, this citrus juice adds a refreshing zing and acidity that can elevate and harmonize other flavors in a drink.\n\nIn cocktails, lemon juice serves multiple purposes. It provides a crisp, clean finish. Its high acidity also helps to cut through rich or sweet components, creating a more balanced and complex taste experience.\n\n\nWhen using lemon juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is always preferred over bottled versions for its superior flavor and aroma. The amount used can vary greatly depending on the recipe, but even a small quantity can significantly impact the final taste of a drink.",
