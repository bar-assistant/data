    "description": "A pisco sour is an alcoholic cocktail of Peruvian origin that is typical of the cuisines from Peru. The drink's name comes from pisco, which is its base liquor, and the cocktail term sour, in reference to sour citrus juice and sweetener components.\nThe Peruvian pisco sour uses Peruvian pisco as the base liquor and adds freshly squeezed lemon juice, simple syrup, ice, egg white, and Angostura bitters.\nThe Chilean version is similar, but uses Chilean pisco and Pica lime, and excludes the bitters and egg white.\nOther variants of the cocktail include those created with fruits like pineapple or plants such as coca leaves.",

            "description": "Lemon juice is a versatile and essential ingredient in many cocktails, prized for its bright, tart flavor and ability to balance sweetness. Extracted from fresh lemons, this citrus juice adds a refreshing zing and acidity that can elevate and harmonize other flavors in a drink.\n\nIn cocktails, lemon juice serves multiple purposes. It provides a crisp, clean finish. Its high acidity also helps to cut through rich or sweet components, creating a more balanced and complex taste experience.\n\n\nWhen using lemon juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is always preferred over bottled versions for its superior flavor and aroma. The amount used can vary greatly depending on the recipe, but even a small quantity can significantly impact the final taste of a drink.",
