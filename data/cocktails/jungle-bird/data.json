    "description": "A tiki cocktail lush with pineapple and lime - plus a hint of Campari's bitterness. The Jungle Bird took off first in 1978 at the Aviary Bar in Kuala Lumpur, but it wasn't until Beachbum Berry himself resurrected it in 2002 that it got back on the radar. This recipe perfectly employs our Pineapple Gum Syrup!",

            "description": "Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer and often in charred barrels, giving it a darker color and a richer, more robust flavor compared to lighter rums. It typically has notes of caramel, molasses, and sometimes spices. Dark rum is commonly used in cocktails, especially those with a strong, flavorful profile, and it is also enjoyed neat or on the rocks. The aging process contributes to the development of complex flavors and a smoother texture.",
