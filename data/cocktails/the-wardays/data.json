    "description": "The Warday’s is an interesting booze filled cocktail with complex roots and I knew immediately I have to make one after listening to the VinePair’s Cocktail College episode with Eryn Reece.\n\nAs mentioned in the podcast, cocktail borrows elements from two sources: Alaska (gin and yellow Chartreuse) and Manhattan (aged spirit, in this case represented by Calvados and sweet vermouth). By blending these ingredients together, a delicious booze filled cocktail is brought to life.\n\nNotes of aged apples and pears are brought by the Calvados and then enriched by the botanicals of sweet vermouth. Gin contributes a healthy dose of juniper as well as a significant bite of alcohol. Final, modest, addition of yellow Chartreuse introduces a lot more herbal and botanical complexity as well as sweetness to the mix, nicely finishing the cocktail.\n\nThe Warday’s is a must try for seasoned cocktail enthusiasts. Rich, complex and delicious to the very last drop.",
