            "description": "Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer and often in charred barrels, giving it a darker color and a richer, more robust flavor compared to lighter rums. It typically has notes of caramel, molasses, and sometimes spices. Dark rum is commonly used in cocktails, especially those with a strong, flavorful profile, and it is also enjoyed neat or on the rocks. The aging process contributes to the development of complex flavors and a smoother texture.",

            "description": "Honey syrup is a natural sweetener used in cocktails to add depth and complexity beyond what standard simple syrup offers. Made by diluting honey with water, usually in a 1:1 ratio, this syrup brings not only sweetness but also subtle floral, herbal, or fruity notes depending on the type of honey used.\n\nWhen incorporating honey syrup into drinks, it's important to consider its distinct flavor profile. The type of honey used can significantly impact the final taste of the cocktail, allowing for creative variations. Bartenders often prefer to make their own honey syrup to control the consistency and flavor, though commercial versions are available. As with other syrups, the amount used can be adjusted to balance the cocktail's sweetness with other components.",
