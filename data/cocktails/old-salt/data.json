The production of tequila is regulated by Mexican law, specifying the geographical areas where it can be produced and the methods used in its production.\n\nTequila Blanco, also known as Tequila Silver or Tequila Plata, is a type of tequila that is typically unaged or aged for a very short period. It is the purest expression of the blue agave flavor, as it is not influenced by the characteristics of aging in oak barrels.\n\nBlanco tequila is a popular choice for those who want to experience the true essence of the agave plant without the influence of aging. It provides a lively and authentic representation of tequila's primary ingredient.",

Extracted from the grapefruit, a citrus fruit larger and more acidic than oranges, this juice brings a complex taste that can range from bracingly sour to subtly sweet, depending on the variety of grapefruit used.\n\n\nIn cocktails, grapefruit juice adds a sophisticated and refreshing element. Its natural bitterness and acidity make it an excellent counterpoint to sweet liqueurs and spirits, creating well-balanced drinks. The juice also contributes a lovely pink or ruby hue to cocktails, enhancing their visual appeal.\nPopular in classics like the Paloma and the Greyhound, grapefruit juice pairs particularly well with tequila, vodka, and gin. When using grapefruit juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is ideal for the brightest flavor, though high-quality bottled juices can be a convenient alternative. The amount used can vary, but its strong flavor means a little often goes a long way in cocktail recipes.",
