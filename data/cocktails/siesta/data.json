    "description": "This spin on the Hemingway Daiquiri was created in 2006 by Katie Stipe (who&#039;s at New York&#039;s Vandaag now.) Tequila adds warmth to bitter Campari; it&#039;s a luxurious cocktail that&#039;s a bit like sipping candied grapefruit peel.\n\n&quot;Katie describes this drink as her first &quot;Aha!&quot; moment when she took a favorite classic cocktail, the Hemingway Daiquiri, and used it as a template to create something new.&quot; (Source: Jim Meehan&#039;s PDT Cocktail Book.)\n\nFor those that might need two cocktails today, you can check out the Hemingway Daiquiri mentioned above, in last year&#039;s Advent of Cocktails, here: AoC 2021, Dec 12: Hemingway Daiquiri",

            "description": "Tequila is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from the fermented juice of the blue agave plant, primarily grown in the Jalisco region of Mexico. The production of tequila is regulated by Mexican law, specifying the geographical areas where it can be produced and the methods used in its production.\n\nTequila Blanco, also known as Tequila Silver or Tequila Plata, is a type of tequila that is typically unaged or aged for a very short period. It is the purest expression of the blue agave flavor, as it is not influenced by the characteristics of aging in oak barrels.\n\nBlanco tequila is a popular choice for those who want to experience the true essence of the agave plant without the influence of aging. It provides a lively and authentic representation of tequila's primary ingredient.",

Its natural bitterness and acidity make it an excellent counterpoint to sweet liqueurs and spirits, creating well-balanced drinks. The juice also contributes a lovely pink or ruby hue to cocktails, enhancing their visual appeal.\nPopular in classics like the Paloma and the Greyhound, grapefruit juice pairs particularly well with tequila, vodka, and gin. When using grapefruit juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is ideal for the brightest flavor, though high-quality bottled juices can be a convenient alternative. The amount used can vary, but its strong flavor means a little often goes a long way in cocktail recipes.",
