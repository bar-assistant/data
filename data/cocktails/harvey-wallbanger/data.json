    "description": "The Harvey Wallbanger was created in 1969 as a marketing campaign by McKesson Imports Company, importer of Galliano, as a means of driving sales of Galliano. The campaign was headed by George Bednar, marketing director of McKesson, and a cartoon character was commissioned from graphic artist William J. \"Bill\" Young in Lima, New York, with the tagline that Bednar claimed to have penned: \"Harvey Wallbanger is the name. And I can be made!\". The Harvey Wallbanger character was a surfer, appearing in various ads during the campaign, and was mentioned in print as early as 1969, continuing into the 1970s.",

It is typically produced from the fermentation and distillation of grains, potatoes, or sometimes fruits. The resulting alcohol is then often filtered and diluted with water to achieve the desired alcohol content.\n\nVodka is characterized by its relatively neutral taste and aroma. It is intentionally distilled to be a clean and pure spirit, allowing it to take on the characteristics of its base ingredients.",

            "description": "Orange juice is a popular and versatile cocktail ingredient, known for its sweet and tangy flavor profile. Extracted from fresh oranges, it brings a natural sweetness and subtle acidity to drinks, along with a bright, sunny color that enhances the visual appeal of cocktails.\n\nWhen using orange juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is ideal for the best flavor, though high-quality, not-from-concentrate commercial juices can be a convenient alternative. The amount used can vary widely depending on the recipe, from a splash for flavor to being the primary mixer in a drink. Its natural sweetness means it's often used in place of simple syrup in some recipes, adding both flavor and sweetness in one ingredient.",

The unique herbal flavor medley is dominated by vanilla and anise, though its taste is complex. Developed in the late 19th century, Galliano is used in a variety of cocktails and is a staple in well-rounded bars today. Its most famous cocktails are the Harvey Wallbanger and golden Cadillac from the 1970s. While it's great for those retro drinks and many others, it also makes a nice digestif to enjoy after a meal.",
