The standard recipe is a 1:1 ratio of sugar to water, although variations exist, such as rich simple syrup, which uses a 2:1 ratio for a thicker, sweeter result. The syrup is clear and easily mixes with both cold and hot liquids, making it an essential ingredient in many drinks.\n\nSimple syrup can also be infused with additional flavors like herbs, spices, or fruits, adding a layer of complexity to cocktails.",
