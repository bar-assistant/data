            "description": "A type of American whiskey, primarily made from corn and aged in new charred oak barrels. Bourbon has a sweet and full-bodied flavor profile.\n\nTo be labeled as bourbon, a whiskey must meet the following criteria:\n\n1.

Distillation: Bourbon must be distilled to no more than 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume) and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume).\n\n3. Barrel Aging: Bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels. There is no minimum aging requirement for bourbon, but to be labeled as \"straight bourbon,\" it must be aged for at least two years.\n\n4. No Additives: Bourbon must not contain any additives except water to adjust the proof.\n\n5. Bottling Strength: Bourbon must be bottled at a minimum of 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume).\n\n6. Geographic Origin: While bourbon can be produced anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with Kentucky, and many consider Kentucky bourbon to be a distinctive category.",

            "description": "Club soda is a carbonated water that contains added minerals such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, and potassium sulfate, which give it a slightly salty and mineral-rich flavor. It is commonly used in cocktails as a mixer to add effervescence and a light, refreshing touch without altering the drink’s flavor profile significantly. The bubbles in club soda help to lift and blend the flavors of other ingredients, creating a more balanced and lively drink.\n\nIn cocktails, club soda is often used to top off drinks, adding volume and fizz. It's a key ingredient in classics like the Tom Collins, where it complements the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup by adding a sparkling finish. It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors. Its clean, neutral taste makes it an ideal mixer for a wide range of cocktails, contributing to the drink’s texture and mouthfeel without overshadowing the primary ingredients.",
