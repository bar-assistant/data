    "description": "The Japanese cocktail is notorious for a handful of things: it's a very old cocktail, published in Jerry Thomas’s landmark 1862 book How to Mix Drinks; it was the first mixed drink to be named something other than “Whiskey Cocktail”, “Brandy Cocktail”, or some other similarly obvious epithet; it might be the only cocktail Thomas invented himself; and finally, it was the first cocktail to feature more than a dash of a fancy sweetener, orgeat.",

            "description": "Brandy is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented fruit juice, most commonly derived from wine. The fruit used can include grapes, apples, pears, or other fruits. The process of making brandy involves fermenting the fruit sugars into alcohol and then distilling the resulting liquid to increase its alcohol content. After distillation, brandy is often aged in wooden barrels, which contributes to its flavor, color, and aroma.\n\nThere are a few types of brandy:\n\n- V.S. (\"very special\") or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.\n- V.S.O.P. (\"very superior old pale\"), Reserve or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.\n- XO (\"extra old\") or Napoléon designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.\n- Hors d'âge ('beyond age') is a designation formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac it designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice, the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.\n\nBrandy has a rich history and is produced in many regions around the world, each with its own traditions and methods. The quality and characteristics of brandy can vary widely based on factors such as the type of fruit used, the distillation process, and the aging conditions.",

            "description": "Orgeat syrup is a sweet, nutty syrup that plays a crucial role in many classic and tiki-style cocktails. Traditionally made from almonds, sugar, and orange flower water, orgeat has a distinctive flavor profile that combines nuttiness with subtle floral notes and a rich sweetness.\n\n\nIn cocktails, orgeat syrup adds depth, complexity, and a silky texture. Its unique taste complements a wide range of spirits, particularly rum and whiskey, and it's an essential ingredient in iconic drinks like the Mai Tai and the Japanese Cocktail. The syrup's ability to smooth out harsh edges in spirits while adding its own character makes it a valuable tool in a mixologist's arsenal.\n\n\nWhen using orgeat syrup, a little goes a long way due to its concentrated flavor and sweetness. High-quality commercial versions are readily available, but some bartenders prefer to make their own to control the flavor profile and ingredients. While almond is the traditional base, variations using other nuts like pistachio or hazelnut have become popular in craft cocktail scenes.",

It is a dark brown liquid made from a secret blend of herbs and spices, created by the House of Angostura in Trinidad and Tobago. Despite its name, Angostura bitters does not contain angostura bark; instead, it features a proprietary combination of botanical ingredients.\n\nAngostura bitters typically comes in small bottles with a distinctive oversized label and a built-in dasher top, allowing for controlled and precise pouring.\n\nDespite the name, Angostura bitters is non-alcoholic in the sense that it is not consumed in large quantities and is used as a flavoring agent rather than a beverage on its own.\n\nAngostura bitters has become an iconic and essential ingredient in the world of cocktails, appreciated for its ability to elevate and enhance the overall drinking experience.",
