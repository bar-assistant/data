            "description": "Brandy is a distilled alcoholic beverage made from fermented fruit juice, most commonly derived from wine. The fruit used can include grapes, apples, pears, or other fruits. The process of making brandy involves fermenting the fruit sugars into alcohol and then distilling the resulting liquid to increase its alcohol content. After distillation, brandy is often aged in wooden barrels, which contributes to its flavor, color, and aroma.\n\nThere are a few types of brandy:\n\n- V.S. (\"very special\") or ✯✯✯ (three stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy has been stored for at least two years in a cask.\n- V.S.O.P. (\"very superior old pale\"), Reserve or ✯✯✯✯✯ (five stars) designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least four years in a cask.\n- XO (\"extra old\") or Napoléon designates a blend in which the youngest brandy is stored for at least six years.\n- Hors d'âge ('beyond age') is a designation formally equal to XO for Cognac, but for Armagnac it designates brandy that is at least ten years old. In practice, the term is used by producers to market a high-quality product beyond the official age scale.\n\nBrandy has a rich history and is produced in many regions around the world, each with its own traditions and methods. The quality and characteristics of brandy can vary widely based on factors such as the type of fruit used, the distillation process, and the aging conditions.",
