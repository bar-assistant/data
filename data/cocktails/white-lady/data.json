    "description": "It was first created in 1919 in London by Harry MacElhone and it was equal parts creme de menthe, triple sec and lemon juice. But four years later [1923], when he was working in Paris, France, at Harry&amp;#039;s American Bar, he had changed the recipe. He had swapped out the creme de menthe, for gin. Which, was a good move. But then, four years later [1927], he puts out the book &amp;quot;Barflies and Cocktails&amp;quot; and includes the White Lady, but the recipe no longer had gin. It went back to cremé de menthe, and it didn&amp;#039;t have lemon juice. It had Brandy, and it was no longer equal parts. It was a completely different drink.\n\nBut then, 3 years later, in 1930, Harry Craddock steps in and he puts, in the &amp;quot;The Savoy Cocktail Book&amp;quot;, the White Lady. Gin, triple sec and lemon juice, only he increases the amount of gin to make a drier cocktail. Which is pretty much the cocktail we have today... and it&amp;#039;s a great drink.\n\nA few years after this drink became popular at the American Bar at the Savoy in London, because of Harry Craddock. One of the managers, suggested putting in a little egg white. But to this day, the egg white is considered optional.",

            "description": "Gin is a distilled alcoholic beverage that derives its predominant flavor from juniper berries and other botanicals. It falls under the category of distilled spirits and is known for its diverse and complex flavor profile, which can include herbal, floral, citrus, and spicy notes. The production of gin involves distilling a neutral spirit with botanicals, with juniper being the key botanical required for a spirit to be classified as gin.\n\nThe defining characteristic of gin is the prominent presence of juniper berries in its flavor profile. The name \"gin\" is derived from the French word \"genièvre,\" meaning juniper.\n\nThere are several styles of gin, including London Dry Gin, Plymouth Gin, and New Western or Contemporary-style Gin. Each style has its own production methods and regulations.\n\nGin has a long history and has evolved over centuries, becoming one of the most popular and beloved spirits globally. Its association with a wide array of cocktails makes it a staple in bars and households alike.",

Extracted from fresh lemons, this citrus juice adds a refreshing zing and acidity that can elevate and harmonize other flavors in a drink.\n\nIn cocktails, lemon juice serves multiple purposes. It provides a crisp, clean finish. Its high acidity also helps to cut through rich or sweet components, creating a more balanced and complex taste experience.\n\n\nWhen using lemon juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is always preferred over bottled versions for its superior flavor and aroma. The amount used can vary greatly depending on the recipe, but even a small quantity can significantly impact the final taste of a drink.",
