    "description": "The cocktail originated in the early 20th century in Cuba, after the country won independence in the Spanishâ€“American War. It subsequently became popular across Cuba, the United States, and other countries. Its simple recipe and inexpensive, ubiquitous ingredients have made it one of the world's most-popular alcoholic drinks. Drink critics often consider the drink mediocre, but it has been noted for its historical significance.\n\nTraditionally, the cola ingredient is Coca-Cola (\"Coke\") and the alcohol is a light rum such as Bacardi; however, the drink may be made with various types of rums and cola brands, and lime juice may or may not be included.",
