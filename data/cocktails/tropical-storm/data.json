            "description": "Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer and often in charred barrels, giving it a darker color and a richer, more robust flavor compared to lighter rums. It typically has notes of caramel, molasses, and sometimes spices. Dark rum is commonly used in cocktails, especially those with a strong, flavorful profile, and it is also enjoyed neat or on the rocks. The aging process contributes to the development of complex flavors and a smoother texture.",

Extracted from fresh limes, this citrus juice adds a vibrant, zesty kick to drinks, making it an indispensable ingredient in many classic and contemporary cocktails.\n\n\nWhen using lime juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is highly recommended for its superior taste and aroma. The amount used can vary depending on the recipe, but even a small quantity can significantly brighten and enliven a drink. Its versatility allows it to pair well with a wide range of spirits, from tequila and rum to gin and vodka.",
