            "description": "Dry Vermouth is a type of fortified wine that is aromatized with various botanicals, including herbs, spices, and sometimes citrus peels. It is characterized by its dry and less sweet profile compared to sweet vermouth. Dry Vermouth is a key ingredient in classic cocktails such as the Martini and the Manhattan, where it adds complexity and a subtle herbal note to the drink. It is typically white or pale yellow in color and is often enjoyed as a chilled aperitif on its own. The alcohol content of Dry Vermouth is fortified with additional spirits, usually grape brandy, which also contributes to its flavor and preservation.",
