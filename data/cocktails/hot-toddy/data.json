            "description": "A type of American whiskey, primarily made from corn and aged in new charred oak barrels. Bourbon has a sweet and full-bodied flavor profile.\n\nTo be labeled as bourbon, a whiskey must meet the following criteria:\n\n1. Grain Mash Composition: Bourbon must be made from a grain mash that is at least 51% corn. The remaining portion of the mash can include other grains such as barley, rye, and wheat.\n\n2. Distillation: Bourbon must be distilled to no more than 160 proof (80% alcohol by volume) and entered into the barrel for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume).\n\n3. Barrel Aging: Bourbon must be aged in new charred oak barrels. There is no minimum aging requirement for bourbon, but to be labeled as \"straight bourbon,\" it must be aged for at least two years.\n\n4. No Additives: Bourbon must not contain any additives except water to adjust the proof.\n\n5. Bottling Strength: Bourbon must be bottled at a minimum of 80 proof (40% alcohol by volume).\n\n6. Geographic Origin: While bourbon can be produced anywhere in the United States, it is strongly associated with Kentucky, and many consider Kentucky bourbon to be a distinctive category.",

            "description": "Honey syrup is a natural sweetener used in cocktails to add depth and complexity beyond what standard simple syrup offers. Made by diluting honey with water, usually in a 1:1 ratio, this syrup brings not only sweetness but also subtle floral, herbal, or fruity notes depending on the type of honey used.\n\nWhen incorporating honey syrup into drinks, it's important to consider its distinct flavor profile. The type of honey used can significantly impact the final taste of the cocktail, allowing for creative variations. Bartenders often prefer to make their own honey syrup to control the consistency and flavor, though commercial versions are available. As with other syrups, the amount used can be adjusted to balance the cocktail's sweetness with other components.",
