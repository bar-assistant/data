    "description": "This off-the-radar classic cocktail was originally made with equal measures of Scotch whisky, dry vermouth, and sweet vermouth. At Bramble in Edinburgh, co-owner Jason Scott has developed, well, an affinity for the Affinity, brushing up the original recipe by using a Highland single malt (Glenmorangie 10 year old) and swapping in Byrrh Grand Quinquina for the sweet vermouth. The crowning touch? Bramble ages its mixture in barrels; they originally used small casks custom-made for the cocktails by Glenmorangie and are currently using 50-liter barrels that previously held oloroso sherry, aging the cocktail for between three and nine months and using a solera system for consistency. Until you can get to Edinburgh to try one of Bramble’s barrel-aged Affinity cocktails in person, here’s the base recipe, which should give you a delicious taste of the possibilities.",

It is characterized by its dry and less sweet profile compared to sweet vermouth. Dry Vermouth is a key ingredient in classic cocktails such as the Martini and the Manhattan, where it adds complexity and a subtle herbal note to the drink. It is typically white or pale yellow in color and is often enjoyed as a chilled aperitif on its own. The alcohol content of Dry Vermouth is fortified with additional spirits, usually grape brandy, which also contributes to its flavor and preservation.",

It is a dark brown liquid made from a secret blend of herbs and spices, created by the House of Angostura in Trinidad and Tobago. Despite its name, Angostura bitters does not contain angostura bark; instead, it features a proprietary combination of botanical ingredients.\n\nAngostura bitters typically comes in small bottles with a distinctive oversized label and a built-in dasher top, allowing for controlled and precise pouring.\n\nDespite the name, Angostura bitters is non-alcoholic in the sense that it is not consumed in large quantities and is used as a flavoring agent rather than a beverage on its own.\n\nAngostura bitters has become an iconic and essential ingredient in the world of cocktails, appreciated for its ability to elevate and enhance the overall drinking experience.",
