    "description": "The origin of the cocktail is usually credited to Harry MacElhone at Harry's New York Bar in Paris in the 1930s as a derivative of the sidecar. However, competing theories exist that claim the cocktail was created at The Berkeley in approximately 1921, or in French brothels as an ap√©ritif for consumption by the prostitutes.",

            "description": "Cognac is a high-quality French brandy produced in the Cognac region, located in the Charente department. It is renowned for its refined and complex flavor profile, resulting from a meticulous production process. Cognac is made exclusively from white grapes, primarily Ugni Blanc, Folle Blanche, and Colombard, which are fermented and distilled using traditional copper pot stills.\n\nCognac's aging process plays a crucial role in its development, as it absorbs characteristics from the oak barrels, contributing notes of vanilla, caramel, and spices. The region's unique maritime climate, with a mix of oceanic and continental influences, further enhances the maturation process.\n\nCognac is renowned for its smooth and elegant taste, with a harmonious balance of fruity, floral, and oaky elements. It is often enjoyed as a sipping spirit and is a key ingredient in classic cocktails like the Sidecar and Brandy Alexander. The production of Cognac is strictly regulated, ensuring that only spirits meeting specific criteria can bear the prestigious Cognac label.",
