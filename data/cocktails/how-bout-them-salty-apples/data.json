Despite its name, allspice is a single spice, not a blend. The berries have flavors reminiscent of a combination of cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg, hence the name \"allspice.\"\n\nTo make allspice dram, the dried allspice berries are crushed or ground and then steeped in high-proof alcohol to extract their flavors. This infusion is typically sweetened with sugar, resulting in a sweet and spiced liqueur. The final product often has a warm and aromatic profile, with notes of cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg.\n\nAllspice dram is used as a flavoring agent in cocktails, adding depth and complexity to drinks. It's a common ingredient in classic and modern tiki cocktails, where its spice-forward profile complements tropical fruit flavors.",
