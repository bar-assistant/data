The skins impart color, tannins, and various flavors to the wine. Red wines can range from light and fruity to rich and full-bodied, and they are typically enjoyed at room temperature. Popular red grape varieties include Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Pinot Noir, and Syrah, among others. Red wine is known for its diverse flavor profiles and is often paired with a variety of foods.",
