    "instructions": "Combine all the ingredients except the orange twist in an Old Fashioned glass filled with one large ice cube. Stir until chilled. To top with a flamed orange twist, carefully hold a piece of orange peel about the size of a silver dollar, skin side down, over the drink. Light a match and use it to warm the skin side of the peel. Holding the match a few inches above the drink, quickly squeeze the peel in the direction of the match. The oil from the peel will briefly ignite, landing over the drink’s surface.",

            "description": "Tequila Reposado is a type of tequila that has been aged or \"rested\" in oak barrels for a specific period, giving it a mellower and more complex flavor compared to Tequila Blanco (unaged tequila). The term \"reposado\" translates to \"rested\" in Spanish.\n\nReposado occupies a middle ground between the youthful vibrancy of Blanco tequila and the more mature and complex characteristics of Añejo tequila. It appeals to those who appreciate a balance of agave flavor and the influence of oak aging.",

            "description": "Mezcal is a distilled alcoholic beverage that originates from Mexico, known for its distinctive smoky flavor. It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used. The production of mezcal involves roasting the agave hearts (piñas) in underground pits, which imparts a smoky character to the final product. After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

The syrup is a popular alternative to traditional sweeteners like sugar and honey, particularly in the context of natural and organic food products.\n\nAgave syrup is praised for its sweetness and versatility. It is sweeter than sugar, so smaller amounts can be used to achieve the same level of sweetness. Additionally, it has a lower glycemic index compared to some other sweeteners, meaning it has a smaller impact on blood sugar levels.\n\nAgave syrup has a mild, neutral flavor, making it suitable for a variety of culinary applications. It is commonly used as a sweetener in beverages, baked goods, and desserts. However, it's essential to note that agave syrup, like any sweetener, should be consumed in moderation due to its high fructose content.",
