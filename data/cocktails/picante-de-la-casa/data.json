Hand clap the cilantro (to release the aroma, place the leaves or sprig in one hand and gently smack it with the other – this warms up the garnish slightly and starts to extract the oils before you use it), and drop in.\n3. Add the rest of the ingredients, shake and fine strain into an ice-filled rocks glass (a short tumbler used for serving spirits).\n4. Cut off the top end  the chili pepper and place – stem upwards – on top.",

The picante is based on the much-loved margarita, but the picante cocktail ingredients includes chilli and coriander – to add a little extra heat and spice. It is revelatory – and a drink you’ll be coming back to.",

The term \"reposado\" translates to \"rested\" in Spanish.\n\nReposado occupies a middle ground between the youthful vibrancy of Blanco tequila and the more mature and complex characteristics of Añejo tequila. It appeals to those who appreciate a balance of agave flavor and the influence of oak aging.",

The syrup is a popular alternative to traditional sweeteners like sugar and honey, particularly in the context of natural and organic food products.\n\nAgave syrup is praised for its sweetness and versatility. It is sweeter than sugar, so smaller amounts can be used to achieve the same level of sweetness. Additionally, it has a lower glycemic index compared to some other sweeteners, meaning it has a smaller impact on blood sugar levels.\n\nAgave syrup has a mild, neutral flavor, making it suitable for a variety of culinary applications. It is commonly used as a sweetener in beverages, baked goods, and desserts. However, it's essential to note that agave syrup, like any sweetener, should be consumed in moderation due to its high fructose content.",

Made by diluting honey with water, usually in a 1:1 ratio, this syrup brings not only sweetness but also subtle floral, herbal, or fruity notes depending on the type of honey used.\n\nWhen incorporating honey syrup into drinks, it's important to consider its distinct flavor profile. The type of honey used can significantly impact the final taste of the cocktail, allowing for creative variations. Bartenders often prefer to make their own honey syrup to control the consistency and flavor, though commercial versions are available. As with other syrups, the amount used can be adjusted to balance the cocktail's sweetness with other components.",
