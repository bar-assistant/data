It provides a crisp, clean finish. Its high acidity also helps to cut through rich or sweet components, creating a more balanced and complex taste experience.\n\n\nWhen using lemon juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is always preferred over bottled versions for its superior flavor and aroma. The amount used can vary greatly depending on the recipe, but even a small quantity can significantly impact the final taste of a drink.",

Its unique taste complements a wide range of spirits, particularly rum and whiskey, and it's an essential ingredient in iconic drinks like the Mai Tai and the Japanese Cocktail. The syrup's ability to smooth out harsh edges in spirits while adding its own character makes it a valuable tool in a mixologist's arsenal.\n\n\nWhen using orgeat syrup, a little goes a long way due to its concentrated flavor and sweetness. High-quality commercial versions are readily available, but some bartenders prefer to make their own to control the flavor profile and ingredients. While almond is the traditional base, variations using other nuts like pistachio or hazelnut have become popular in craft cocktail scenes.",
