    "description": "The tricky thing when it comes to low ABV drinks is that the end result doesn’t always give that same feeling of a proper mixed drink. They can easily lack complexity and fall flat. On imbibes website they state this drink is “half the booze and double the flavor” which describes this drink perfectly.",

            "description": "Grapefruit juice is a bold and distinctive cocktail ingredient, known for its tart, bitter-sweet flavor profile. Extracted from the grapefruit, a citrus fruit larger and more acidic than oranges, this juice brings a complex taste that can range from bracingly sour to subtly sweet, depending on the variety of grapefruit used.\n\n\nIn cocktails, grapefruit juice adds a sophisticated and refreshing element. Its natural bitterness and acidity make it an excellent counterpoint to sweet liqueurs and spirits, creating well-balanced drinks. The juice also contributes a lovely pink or ruby hue to cocktails, enhancing their visual appeal.\nPopular in classics like the Paloma and the Greyhound, grapefruit juice pairs particularly well with tequila, vodka, and gin. When using grapefruit juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is ideal for the brightest flavor, though high-quality bottled juices can be a convenient alternative. The amount used can vary, but its strong flavor means a little often goes a long way in cocktail recipes.",

            "description": "Mezcal is a distilled alcoholic beverage that originates from Mexico, known for its distinctive smoky flavor. It is made from the agave plant, primarily the species Agave espadin, although other agave varieties can be used. The production of mezcal involves roasting the agave hearts (piñas) in underground pits, which imparts a smoky character to the final product. After roasting, the agave is crushed, fermented, and then distilled, resulting in a spirit with a wide range of flavors, including earthy, fruity, and herbal notes.\n\nThe traditional production methods involve cooking the agave in earthen pits lined with lava rocks and filled with wood and charcoal. This underground roasting process gives mezcal its distinctive smoky taste.\n\nMezcal is produced in specific regions of Mexico, with Oaxaca being a particularly renowned area for its high-quality mezcals. The production of mezcal is regulated, and the spirit has a Denomination of Origin (DO) to ensure authenticity and quality.\n\nUnlike some other agave spirits, such as tequila, which is made from Blue Agave, mezcal can be produced from a variety of agave types, contributing to the spirit's diversity.\n\nMezcal is deeply rooted in Mexican culture and has gained international recognition for its artisanal production methods and diverse flavor profile.",

            "description": "Club soda is a carbonated water that contains added minerals such as sodium bicarbonate, sodium chloride, and potassium sulfate, which give it a slightly salty and mineral-rich flavor. It is commonly used in cocktails as a mixer to add effervescence and a light, refreshing touch without altering the drink’s flavor profile significantly. The bubbles in club soda help to lift and blend the flavors of other ingredients, creating a more balanced and lively drink.\n\nIn cocktails, club soda is often used to top off drinks, adding volume and fizz. It's a key ingredient in classics like the Tom Collins, where it complements the gin, lemon juice, and simple syrup by adding a sparkling finish. It is also essential in making a Highball, where it dilutes the whiskey and adds a refreshing effervescence, or in a Mojito, where it lightens the mixture of rum, mint, lime, and sugar.\n\nClub soda is preferred over other carbonated waters like tonic water or seltzer when the goal is to add carbonation without additional flavors. Its clean, neutral taste makes it an ideal mixer for a wide range of cocktails, contributing to the drink’s texture and mouthfeel without overshadowing the primary ingredients.",
