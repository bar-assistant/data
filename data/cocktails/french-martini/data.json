The cocktail was produced during the 1980sâ€“1990s cocktail renaissance.\n\nIt is not a true martini, but is one of many drinks that incorporate the term martini into their names.

It is typically produced from the fermentation and distillation of grains, potatoes, or sometimes fruits. The resulting alcohol is then often filtered and diluted with water to achieve the desired alcohol content.\n\nVodka is characterized by its relatively neutral taste and aroma. It is intentionally distilled to be a clean and pure spirit, allowing it to take on the characteristics of its base ingredients.",
