It is known for its fizzy and slightly spicy taste, derived from the natural or artificial ginger flavorings used in its production. Ginger ale is often consumed on its own as a refreshing soft drink, and it is also a common mixer in various cocktails. There are both commercial and homemade versions of ginger ale, with variations that may include additional ingredients such as citrus or sweeteners.",
