            "description": "Dark rum is a type of rum that is aged longer and often in charred barrels, giving it a darker color and a richer, more robust flavor compared to lighter rums. It typically has notes of caramel, molasses, and sometimes spices. Dark rum is commonly used in cocktails, especially those with a strong, flavorful profile, and it is also enjoyed neat or on the rocks. The aging process contributes to the development of complex flavors and a smoother texture.",

            "description": "Lemon juice is a versatile and essential ingredient in many cocktails, prized for its bright, tart flavor and ability to balance sweetness. Extracted from fresh lemons, this citrus juice adds a refreshing zing and acidity that can elevate and harmonize other flavors in a drink.\n\nIn cocktails, lemon juice serves multiple purposes. It provides a crisp, clean finish. Its high acidity also helps to cut through rich or sweet components, creating a more balanced and complex taste experience.\n\n\nWhen using lemon juice in cocktails, freshly squeezed is always preferred over bottled versions for its superior flavor and aroma. The amount used can vary greatly depending on the recipe, but even a small quantity can significantly impact the final taste of a drink.",
