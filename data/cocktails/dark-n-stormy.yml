description: |-
    This drink is very similar to the Moscow mule except that the Dark 'n' Stormy has dark rum instead of vodka. The original Dark 'n' Stormy was made with Gosling Black Seal rum and Barritt's Ginger Beer, but after the partnership between the two failed and the companies parted ways, Gosling Brothers created its own ginger beer.

    Gosling Brothers claims that the drink was invented in Bermuda just after World War I.
garnish: Garnish with a lime wedge or slice.
